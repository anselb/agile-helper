# Agile Helper

A Go tool to help you do agile development

Agile helper will (eventually) help you do these two things:
- Take your Trello or GitHub Project board tasks and place them on your calendar within certain specifications such as:
   - Avoiding other events already on your calendar
   - What time you start and end work
   - If you work on the weekends
- Calculate the total number of points committed in at the start of a sprint, the number of points completed at the end of a sprint, and your average points completed per sprint.
