# What Will be Done by the End of BEW 2.5

To get started the project will:
- Make calls to the Trello API to get all the lists from a board, and then all the cards from a list.
- Get the assigned point count for each card, and sum them all together.
- Store the sum in a database to eventually keep track of each sprint.
- Have a file that explores all the necessary tools of the calendar API package to eventually integrate Google Calendar.
